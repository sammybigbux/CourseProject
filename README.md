# CourseProject
I'd like to collect all my notes into an interactive course, with the ultimate goal of publishing the course materials on coursera. The audience for this course is laymen who want to incorporate Gen AI into their personal work. I want this to be non-technical, meaning none of it should require a person to understand how to code.

The structure of the course will be based around 3 projects that cover different domains.

- Accounting

This project will take some data from a spreadsheet and transform it using a large lanugage model. This is a super common task that accountants need to do.

- Marketing

This project will take do social media marketing by auto-generating some marketing material based on announcements.

- TBD

The course will have 5 sections
1) Introduction to AI, and specifically Generative AI
2) Introduction to large language models.
3) Introduction to image generation.
4) First project
5) Second project
6) Third project

Each of the project sections will include an interview with a subject matter expert.
