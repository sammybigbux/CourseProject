# CourseProject
I'd like to collect all my notes into an interactive course, with the ultimate goal of publishing the course materials on coursera. The audience for this course is laymen who want to incorporate Gen AI into their personal work. I want this to be non-technical, meaning none of it should require a person to understand how to code.
